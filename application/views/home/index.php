            <div class="col-text">I wanted to try a new framework for web building unlike the C# .NET I'm used too.
                CodeIgniter looked right up my alley and gave me a lot of insight into PHP coding
                as well as MySQL. Working out of the CMD prompt for most of this project sucked
                but it got me familiar enough with it now that it is not so intimidating. Booyah!</div>

            <div class="col-text">Much like trying out a new framework, I wanted to try some new web design concepts. You can tell by this page I added
            a little bit of "pizzaz" to it using a parallax design (sorry mobile users, not for you) and using CSS grid to handle my 
            repsonsiveness unlike the bootstrap I'm used to.</div>

            <div class="col-text">I thought "What am I going to put on this thing?" then it dawned on me. Why not use it as a personal portfolio for EVERYTHING.
            Photos, videos, favorite movies, etc. with more being added whenever I feel like it. I'll just have to start sending this link out
            at parties.</div>

            <h4>Front-End</h4>
            <div class="col-text">I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JQuery for some of the events on the page. I started to use
            CSS grid to create a responsive design and I used the default bootstrap CSS because styling isn't my first priority. I tried
            to design this website much like company pages do now-a-days. You can see I used the parallax effect on CSS, explaining my site
            in blocks that scroll on the page. I don't know what else I'm just rambeling on.</div>

            <h4>Backend (The Fun Stuff No One Sees)</h4>
            <div class="col-text">On to the main reason I made this. As I mentioned before I wanted to try out something new other than the
            C# ASP.NET MVC stuff I'm used to, so I switched to CodeIgniter. The Idea was given to me by a potential employer and I took the 
            concept and ran. I found out that after the inital set-up and getting out of visual studio that this framework is awesome. I also 
            got some expierence with a new SQL database type: MySQL. It was a bit daunting working exclusivley out of the command prompt but 
            after a while I got used to it. I have 4 tables in here at the moment (all relate to that 'movies' page) with more along the way.</div>

            <h4>Other Stuff</h4>
            <p>I also got myself familar with Amazon Web Service's S3 buckets and pulling images from them instead of loading them in the web folder.</p>
